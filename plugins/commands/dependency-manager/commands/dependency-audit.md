# Enterprise Dependency Management & Security Audit

Execute comprehensive dependency analysis and optimization for project: **$ARGUMENTS**

## OBJECTIVE
Transform dependency management from operational overhead into strategic security and performance optimization that enhances system security by 80-90%, improves bundle performance by 40-50%, and ensures compliance excellence through automated dependency governance.

## EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Dependency Analysis
```bash
# DevsForge Dependency Analysis Engine
project_path=$1
dependency_context=$(comprehensive_dependency_assessment $project_path)

# Strategic dependency evaluation
vulnerability_scan=$(execute_security_vulnerability_scanning $dependency_context)
license_compliance=$(perform_license_compliance_analysis $dependency_context)
bundle_analysis=$(analyze_bundle_size_optimization $dependency_context)
dependency_graph=(generate_dependency_visualization $dependency_context)
outdated_packages=(identify_outdated_dependencies $dependency_context)
security_advisories=(check_security_advisories $dependency_context)
performance_impact=(assess_performance_impact $dependency_context)
```

### Phase 2: Security Vulnerability Assessment
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: Identify and prioritize CVEs and security advisories
- **Dependency Chain Analysis**: Check transitive dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **Patch Management**: Automated security updates and vulnerability remediation
- **Security Policy Enforcement**: Ensure compliance with organizational security standards
- **Risk Assessment**: Calculate security risk scores and mitigation strategies

### Phase 3: License Compliance Management
- **License Detection**: Identify all package licenses and potential conflicts
- **Compliance Validation**: Ensure adherence to organizational and legal requirements
- **Policy Enforcement**: Automated license policy checking and violation reporting
- **Legal Risk Assessment**: Identify potential legal and compliance risks
- **Documentation Generation**: Create comprehensive license compliance reports

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization
- **Bundle Size Analysis**: Identify large dependencies and optimization opportunities
- **Tree Shaking Optimization**: Ensure unused code elimination
- **Dependency Deduplication**: Remove duplicate dependencies and optimize imports
- **Loading Performance**: Analyze and optimize dependency loading strategies
- **Caching Strategies**: Implement optimal dependency caching mechanisms

### Phase 5: Dependency Update Strategy
- **Safe Update Planning**: Identify packages that can be safely updated
- **Breaking Change Detection**: Analyze potential breaking changes and compatibility
- **Automated Testing**: Test dependency updates in isolation before deployment
- **Rollback Strategies**: Prepare contingency plans for failed updates
- **Update Scheduling**: Plan optimal timing for dependency updates
