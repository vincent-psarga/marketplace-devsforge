# Contributing to DevsForge Marketplace

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the DevsForge Marketplace! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## 🎯 Our Mission

DevsForge Marketplace aims to be the premier destination for high-quality, enterprise-grade plugins that extend Claude Code's capabilities. We believe in:

- **Quality over Quantity**: Every plugin should be well-crafted and thoroughly tested
- **Security First**: All plugins must follow security best practices
- **User Experience**: Plugins should be intuitive and user-friendly
- **Community Driven**: We welcome contributions from the entire community
- **Continuous Improvement**: We're always working to make the marketplace better

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Markdown
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub
- Knowledge of Claude Code and its capabilities
- Understanding of plugin structure (commands vs agents)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork the repository on GitHub
   # Clone your fork locally
   git clone https://github.com/devsforge/marketplace.git
   cd marketplace
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Install development tools
   npm install -g markdownlint-cli
   npm install -g yaml-lint

   # Run validation to check setup
   npm run validate

   ```

## 📝 Plugin Development

### Plugin Types

#### Commands (Slash Commands)
Commands add custom slash commands to Claude Code. They're perfect for:

- Automation tasks
- Code analysis
- System operations
- Quick actions

**Example Structure:**
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: [Bash, Read, Grep]
description: Analyze code for security vulnerabilities
tags: [security, analysis, scanning]
---

# Security Scan

Perform comprehensive security vulnerability scanning...

## Usage
```bash
/security-scan [options]
```
```

#### Agents (AI Agents)
Agents add specialized AI assistants with specific expertise. They're ideal for:

- Specialized knowledge domains
- Complex problem solving
- Consultation and advice
- Creative assistance

**Example Structure:**
```markdown
---
description: Expert in code review and security analysis
capabilities: [code-review, security, expertise]
tools: [Read, Grep, Bash]
version: 1.0.0
---

# Code Reviewer

Expert code review specialist focused on security...

## Capabilities
- Security vulnerability identification
- Performance optimization
- Best practices enforcement
```

#### 🚀 Super Plugins (Advanced)
Super plugins are multi-component platforms combining commands, agents, hooks, and MCP servers. They're ideal for:

- Complete automation platforms
- Multi-agent coordination
- Stateful operations
- Enterprise workspace management
- Complex workflows with validation

**Example Structure:**
```
super-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json       # With hooks & MCP config
├── commands/              # Multiple commands
│   ├── command1.md
│   ├── command2.md
│   └── command3.md
├── agents/                # Multiple agents
│   ├── agent1.md
│   └── agent2.md
├── hooks/
│   └── post-tool-use.md
├── scripts/
│   └── validate.sh
└── servers/
    └── mcp-server.js
```

**plugin.json Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "my-super-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "category": "super",
  "commands": [
    "./commands/command1.md",
    "./commands/command2.md"
  ],
  "agents": [
    "./agents/agent1.md",
    "./agents/agent2.md"
  ],
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Write|Edit",
      "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate.sh"}]
    }]
  },
  "mcpServers": {
    "state-tracker": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/mcp-server.js"]
    }
  },
  "strict": false
}
```
