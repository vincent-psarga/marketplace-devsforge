## Branching Strategies

### Git Flow Hotfix Model

**Hotfix Branch Creation:**
```bash
# Create from production tag
git checkout -b hotfix/2.1.1 v2.1.0
git push -u origin hotfix/2.1.1

# Make critical fix
git add .
git commit -m "hotfix: fix payment processing null pointer exception

- Add null check for payment method
- Add defensive validation
- Add error logging

Resolves: PROD-2847
Severity: Critical"

# Tag hotfix version
git tag -a v2.1.1 -m "Hotfix: Payment processing fix"
git push origin v2.1.1
```

**Merge Strategy:**
```bash
# Merge to production
git checkout production
git merge --no-ff hotfix/2.1.1
git push origin production

# Merge to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/2.1.1
git push origin develop

# Clean up hotfix branch
git branch -d hotfix/2.1.1
git push origin --delete hotfix/2.1.1
```

### Trunk-Based Hotfix Model

**Direct Production Fix:**
```bash
# Create hotfix from production
git checkout production
git pull origin production
git checkout -b hotfix/payment-fix

# Make fix and fast-forward
git add .
git commit -m "hotfix: payment processing fix"

# Deploy directly
git checkout production
git merge --ff-only hotfix/payment-fix
git push origin production

# Cherry-pick to main
git checkout main
git cherry-pick <hotfix-commit-sha>
git push origin main
```

## Deployment Workflows

### Blue-Green Deployment

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# Kubernetes blue-green deployment
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
    version: blue  # Switch to 'green' for deployment
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080

---
# Blue deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-blue
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
      version: blue
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        version: blue
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:v2.1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080

---
# Green deployment (new version)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-green
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
      version: green
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        version: green
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:v2.1.1  # New hotfix version
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

**Deployment Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Blue-green deployment script

CURRENT_VERSION=$(kubectl get service app-service -o jsonpath='{.spec.selector.version}')
NEW_VERSION=$([ "$CURRENT_VERSION" = "blue" ] && echo "green" || echo "blue")

echo "Current version: $CURRENT_VERSION"
echo "Deploying to: $NEW_VERSION"

# Deploy new version
kubectl apply -f deployment-$NEW_VERSION.yaml

# Wait for pods to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l version=$NEW_VERSION --timeout=300s

# Run smoke tests
./run-smoke-tests.sh $NEW_VERSION

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Smoke tests passed. Switching traffic..."
  kubectl patch service app-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"'$NEW_VERSION'"}}}'
  echo "Deployment successful!"
else
  echo "Smoke tests failed. Rolling back..."
  kubectl delete deployment app-$NEW_VERSION
  exit 1
fi
```

### Canary Deployment

**Progressive Rollout:**
```yaml
# Istio VirtualService for canary
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: app-canary
spec:
  hosts:
  - app.example.com
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        canary:
          exact: "true"
    route:
    - destination:
        host: app-service
        subset: v2-1-1
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: app-service
        subset: v2-1-0
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: app-service
        subset: v2-1-1
      weight: 10  # Start with 10% traffic
```

**Automated Canary Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Progressive canary deployment

WEIGHTS=(10 25 50 75 100)
CANARY_DURATION=300  # 5 minutes per stage

for WEIGHT in "${WEIGHTS[@]}"; do
  echo "Deploying canary with ${WEIGHT}% traffic..."

  # Update traffic split
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: app-canary
spec:
  hosts:
  - app.example.com
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: app-service
        subset: v2-1-0
      weight: $((100 - WEIGHT))
    - destination:
        host: app-service
        subset: v2-1-1
      weight: $WEIGHT
EOF

  echo "Monitoring for ${CANARY_DURATION} seconds..."
  sleep $CANARY_DURATION

  # Check error rates
  ERROR_RATE=$(prometheus-query "rate(http_requests_total{status=~'5..'}[5m])")

  if (( $(echo "$ERROR_RATE > 0.01" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "Error rate too high! Rolling back..."
    kubectl apply -f virtualservice-stable.yaml
    exit 1
  fi

  echo "Stage ${WEIGHT}% successful"
done

echo "Canary deployment complete!"
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback

**Kubernetes Rollback:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Immediate rollback script

echo "Initiating emergency rollback..."

# Rollback deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/app-deployment

# Wait for rollback to complete
kubectl rollout status deployment/app-deployment --timeout=300s

# Verify health
HEALTH=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://app.example.com/health)

if [ "$HEALTH" = "200" ]; then
  echo "Rollback successful. Application healthy."

  # Notify team
  curl -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "text": "🔄 Emergency rollback completed successfully",
      "attachments": [{
        "color": "good",
        "text": "Application health verified. Production stable."
      }]
    }'
else
  echo "Rollback failed! Health check returned: $HEALTH"
  echo "Escalating to on-call engineer..."
  ./escalate-incident.sh
  exit 1
fi
```

**Database Rollback:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Database migration rollback

echo "Rolling back database migrations..."

# Get current migration version
CURRENT_VERSION=$(psql -tAc "SELECT version FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 1")
echo "Current migration: $CURRENT_VERSION"

# Rollback last migration
npm run migrate:rollback

# Verify database integrity
npm run db:verify

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Database rollback successful"
else
  echo "Database rollback failed! Manual intervention required."
  echo "Creating database snapshot for recovery..."
  pg_dump dbname > emergency-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql
  exit 1
fi
```
